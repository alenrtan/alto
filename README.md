# Alto

- Alto is a simple Chrome extension that provides real-time weather data using the [OpenMeteo API](https://open-meteo.com/).
- 'Alto' comes from "Altocumulus", a small _dotted-like_ cloud found in settled weather.   
- Alto is a passion project of mine; combining my love for the weather and programming.
